I've been working as a software engineer, primarily focused on front-end development, for a few years now. I recently started a new job as a senior front-end engineer at a company called [Omada Health](https://www.omadahealth.com/). During my job search, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the most important questions to ask when applying for a software engineering job. I was looking for somewhere that would facilitate my growth, where I could make an impact, and where I would enjoy my work. So far, I believe I've found a company that meets these qualifications and then some. In this post, I want to present some of the questions I asked during the interview process that helped me make the decision to choose Omada. These questions are roughly divided into categories including company info, people and processes, product, and engineering. I think they represent a good baseline of the info a software engineer needs to decide on a new position. I'll go through each of these categories and explain their questions.
