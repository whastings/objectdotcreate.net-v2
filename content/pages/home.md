# About Me

I am a web developer who is passionate about quality code, best practices,
security, and performance. Currently, my main professional focus is JavaScript,
and my primary interests include the browser as a runtime environment, front-end
frameworks, and HTML5 and CSS3-based user interfaces. I enjoy working on
complex, front-end projects with technologies including jQuery, Backbone,
Angular, and the native DOM API. My favorite projects are those that require me
to push beyond my boundaries and acquire new skills and knowledge in order to
succeed.
