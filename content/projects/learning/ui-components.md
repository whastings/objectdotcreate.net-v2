This is my project for practicing UI component development. I believe one of the
best ways to improve as a frontend engineer is to rebuild common UI solutions
from scratch to learn the intricacies of their implementations and to increase
your understand of browsers' JS and CSS APIs, UX design, and component
accessibility. In the near future, I plan to implement tabs, modals, and many
other UI components so I'm ready to evaluate existing libraries or build new
solutions as needed.
