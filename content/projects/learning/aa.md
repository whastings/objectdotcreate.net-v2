I attended [App Academy][aa] during the beginning of 2014 to supercharge my Ruby,
Rails, and Backbone.js knowledge. During the immersive experience, I worked
on a large variety of projects, via both pair programming and individual
effort. I've collected all my projects from the course, organized for quick
and easy reference.

**Highlights**:

* [ActiveRecord Lite][ar_lite]: A reimplementation of some of ActiveRecord's
  core features.
* [Rails Lite][rails_lite]: A custom implementation of some of the core Rails
  features.
* [Towers of Hanoi][hanoi]: Featuring animation powered by CSS3 and promises.
* [Snake][snake]: The classic game in the browser.
