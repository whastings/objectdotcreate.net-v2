Written as my final project for [App Academy][aa], the idea of Heapsort was to
be a proof-of-concept for a site hosting a socially-curated list of web
development and programming resources. Users could browse, post, favorite, vote
on, and comment on links to resources. Users could also subscribe to categories
to form a feed of resources that match their interests.

I implemented Heapsort as a Marionette/Backbone.js app using Bootstrap and
Browserify, and backed by a Rails API server.
