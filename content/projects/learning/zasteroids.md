Zasteroids is like the classic asteriods game, but with a zombie twist. I
created it using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript, as well as some fun math. I'm not
a game developer by trade, but it was fun to try my hand at it and learn about
the canvas API and some trig along the way.

**Highlights**

* Smooth gameplay and frame rate using `requestAnimationFrame` and time-based
  animation.
* Reactive event handling via [Bacon.js][bacon-js].
* Player and zombie movement calculated with various applications of
  trigonometry.
* Images drawn and rotated via the canvas API.
* Controlled memory footprint via object pooling.
* Object-oriented design via JS constructors and inheritance.
