Zasteroids is like classic asteriods, but with a zombie twist. I created it
using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript, as well as some fun math.

**Top Accomplishments:**

* Smooth gameplay and frame rate using `requestAnimationFrame` and time-based
  animation.
* Player and zombie movement calculated with various applications of
  trigonometry.
* Images drawn and rotated via the canvas API.
* Controlled memory footprint via object pooling.
* Object-oriented design via JS constructors and inheritance.
