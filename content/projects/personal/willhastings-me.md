This is my personal blog and portfolio site. It's where I play around with and
learn about technologies I'm interested in, like Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL.
It's implemented as a universal React and Redux app backed by an Express API
server. When not working on other projects, I stay busy by trying out new
technologies, techniques, and optimizations on this project, using it to test
out ideas and learn new things that make me a better frontend engineer.

**Highlights:**

* Modern application architecture powered by React and Redux.
* Mobile-first design using Flexbox and media queries.
* Application build via Webpack 2 for ES6+ JS and Sass codebase.
* Server-side rendering of universal JS app for quick initial load.
* JS lazy loading via Webpack code splitting.
* Elegant management of server-side async calls with ES6 generators.
* Sequelize.js-powered model layer powering REST API.
* Older browser support through fetch, Promise, and other ES6 polyfills.
